### Simple portfolio website built using Next.js

### [Live Site](https://devashish-portfolio.vercel.app/)

Currently, the website is a work in progress. I plan to design new pages which I have in mind, after finishing with the skills and projects section.

There are a couple of features and changes I will be doing, which will be listed here later.

### Tech used
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
